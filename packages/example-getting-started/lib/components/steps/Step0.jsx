## Welcome to Vulcan!

This interactive tutorial will teach you the basics of using Vulcan. 
In fact, the tutorial itself is a Vulcan app!

During this tutorial, you'll have to edit a number of files. These are all located inside the **Getting Started** example package, which you can find at \`/your-vulcan-directory/packages/example-getting-started\`.
